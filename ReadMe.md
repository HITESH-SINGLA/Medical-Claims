The purpose of a medical claim website is to provide a platform for Stakeholders to efficiently manage the process of submitting, reviewing, and processing medical claims. The website aims to streamline the claims process, reduce administrative burdens, and improve communication between all parties involved in medical billing and reimbursement. By providing a user-friendly and secure platform for submitting and managing medical claims, the website aims to improve the overall healthcare experience for patients and providers alike.

## Features and Functionalities

1. User Accounts: Stack Holders can create accounts to securely manage their medical claims and associated information.

2. Claim Submission: Patients can submit medical claims online, including information about the medical service provided, and the healthcare provider.

3. Claim Tracking: Users can track the status of their claims, including any approvals or denials.

4. Auto Fill: Auto Fill is a feature that automatically populates form fields with pre-existing data that we collect at the signup time or commonly used values. Auto Fill can save time and reduce errors by automatically filling in patient information.

## Technology Stack

### Database

Our medical claims project utilizes PostgreSQL (psql) as our database, aptly named Elephant. Leveraging its robust features, Elephant efficiently manages medical data, ensuring secure storage and retrieval. With streamlined querying and manipulation, we optimize claim processing and analysis. PostgreSQL's reliability and scalability form the foundation for our project's success in medical claims management.

### Frontend

Our medical claims project's frontend is built using React, providing a dynamic and user-friendly interface. React's component-based architecture enables modular development and seamless updates. With React's efficient state management, we deliver responsive and interactive user experiences. The combination of React and PostgreSQL forms a powerful platform for effective medical claims management.

### Backend

Our medical claims project's backend is powered by Flask, offering a lightweight and flexible framework for handling server-side logic. Flask's simplicity and extensibility facilitate rapid development and easy integration with our PostgreSQL database. With Flask's RESTful routing, we efficiently manage API endpoints for seamless communication between the frontend and the database. Together with React and PostgreSQL, Flask forms a robust and scalable solution for our medical claims management system.

## User Interfaces

Every user who interacts with the system will have the same user interface. The single central interface for interacting with the application will be the web application. This will be a highly visual interface involving a minimal, easy-to-navigate UI. The interface would be primarily useful to users to view the analytics of their applications. The interface will be designed to be intuitive and easy to use. The interface will be designed to be responsive and work on all devices. The interface will be designed to be compatible with all major browsers.
